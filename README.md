My personal projects so far include two analysis programs.
The stock sentiment program pulls news headlines from stock Tickers and compares them to a sentiment database that assigns them a value. The stock's sentiment value is then displayed as a graph.
The Spotify program was my study on how the OAuth workflow works with Spotify API and displays basic information about the user's playlist tracks. The client id and client secret have been removed.
